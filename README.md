# Fully Functional ATM Interface in Python

## Overview
This project is a fully functional ATM interface implemented in Python, created during my internship at *Brainwave Matrix Solutions*. The project aims to simulate the core functionalities of an ATM system, including user account management, transaction handling, and secure authentication.

## Features

- *Account Creation:* Register new users with unique usernames and secure PINs.
- *Login System:* Authenticate users with a 4-digit PIN, allowing multiple attempts.
- *Transaction Management:* Perform transactions including withdrawal, deposit, and transfer, with appropriate validation checks.
- *Transaction History:* View detailed records of past transactions.

## Code Structure

### atm_interface.py
The main script contains the core functionality of the ATM system, implemented as follows:

1. *Account Management:*
    - Users can create new accounts and store their details securely.
    - Accounts are managed in a dictionary, with usernames as keys and PINs and transaction histories as values.

2. *Login System:*
    - Users log in using a 4-digit PIN.
    - The system allows up to 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN before locking the user out.

3. *Transaction Options:*
    - *Withdraw Money:* Users can withdraw funds from their account, with checks to ensure sufficient balance.
    - *Deposit Money:* Users can deposit funds into their account, with validation to confirm the amount.
    - *Transfer Money:* Allows users to transfer money between accounts, with checks for sufficient balance and valid recipient accounts.
    - *View Transaction History:* Users can view their transaction history to track their activities.

### How to Use

1. *Clone the Repository:*
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Khadir-Yassine/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
    
2. *Follow the Prompts:*
    - *Create an Account:* Enter a username and a 4-digit PIN.
    - *Log In:* Provide your username and PIN to access the ATM functions.
    - *Perform Transactions:* Choose from withdrawal, deposit, transfer, or view transaction history.

## Challenges Faced

1. *Input Validation:* Ensuring that user inputs are valid and handling incorrect or unexpected inputs. For instance, making sure the PIN is exactly 4 digits and handling cases where the user tries to withdraw more money than available.
2. *Error Handling:* Properly managing errors such as non-existent usernames during transactions or incorrect PIN entries.
3. *Maintaining State:* Managing user sessions and ensuring that each user’s transactions and account details are handled correctly without conflicts.

## Skills Acquired

- *Python Programming:* Improved skills in Python, especially in handling user inputs, working with dictionaries, and managing program flow.
- *Error Handling:* Gained experience in validating inputs and managing errors gracefully to enhance user experience.
- *User Interface Design:* Learned how to create a text-based user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly.
- *Software Development:* Enhanced understanding of how to structure and organize code for a real-world application.
